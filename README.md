- **Week 2** - JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and analysis
- **Week 3** - OWASP Top 10 API Security (Parts 1-3)
- **Week 4** - OWASP Top 10 API Security and Beyond (Parts 4-10)
- **Week 5** - Comprehensive review and feedback integration
- **Week 6** - API Gateway Security
- **Week 7** - API Security & PCI DSS
- **Week 8** - Connected Systems Security
- **Week 9** - Intro to API Pen-Testing

- **Weeks 10-12** - Advanced topics and specialized security assessments *(Continuous updates)*
