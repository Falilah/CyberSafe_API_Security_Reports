# CyberSafe API Security Training - Lab Reports

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive lab reports and weekly study summaries from the **CyberSafe API Security Training Program**. The documentation captures technical testing, vulnerability analysis, and security assessments across multiple API security domains.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into twelve weeks of progressive API security learning:

- **Week 1** - Introduction to API testing fundamentals
- **Week 2** - JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and analysis
- **Week 3** - OWASP Top 10 API Security (Parts 1-3)
- **Week 4** - OWASP Top 10 API Security and Beyond (Parts 4-10)
- **Week 5** - Comprehensive review and feedback integration
- **Weeks 6-12** - Advanced topics and specialized security assessments *(Continuous updates)*
